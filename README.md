# Scatterplot Visualization Using R
***
## Overview
***
The objective was to replicate a graph from The Economist [Corrosive corruption](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption "The Economist"). The graph shows a correlation between corruption and development in countries around the world. Instead of completely replicating the graph, I selected certain countries of interest to use and changed some of the visual aspects.
